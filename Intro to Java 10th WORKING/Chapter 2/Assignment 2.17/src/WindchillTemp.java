// (Science: wind-chill temperature) 
// How cold is it outside? The temperature alone is not enough to provide the answer. 
// Other factors including wind speed, relative humidity, and sunshine play important 
// roles in determining coldness outside.

// In 2001, the National Weather Service (NWS) implemented the new wind-chill
// temperature to measure the coldness using temperature and wind speed. The
// formula is:

// 				Twc = 35.74 + (0.6215 * Ta) - (35.75 * v^0.16) + (0.4275 * Ta * v^0.16)

// where ta is the outside temperature measured in degrees Fahrenheit and v is the
// speed measured in miles per hour. twc is the wind-chill temperature. The formula
// cannot be used for wind speeds below 2 mph or temperatures below -58 �F or
// above 41�F.

// Write a program that prompts the user to enter a temperature between -58 �F and
// 41�F and a wind speed greater than or equal to 2 and displays the wind-chill temperature.
// Use Math.pow(a, b) to compute v0.16. 

// Here is a sample run:

import java.util.Scanner;

public class WindchillTemp {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);
		
	}

}
