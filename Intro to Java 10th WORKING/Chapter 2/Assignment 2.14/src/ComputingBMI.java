// (Health application: computing BMI) 
// Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of health on weight. It can be calculated by taking your 
// weight in kilograms and dividing by the square of your height in meters. Write a program that 
// prompts the user to enter a weight in pounds and height in inches and displays the BMI. 

// Note  that one pound is 0.45359237 kilograms and one inch is 0.0254 meters. 

// Here is a sample run:
// Enter weight in pounds: 95.5
// Enter height in inches: 50
// BMI is 26.8573
