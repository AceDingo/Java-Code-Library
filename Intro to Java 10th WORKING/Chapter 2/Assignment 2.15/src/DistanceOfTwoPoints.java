// (Geometry: distance of two points) 
// Write a program that prompts the user to enter two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) and displays 
// their distance between them.

// The formula for computing the distance is sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2). Note that
// you can use Math.pow(a, 0.5) to compute 2a. 

// Here is a sample run:
// Enter x1 and y1: 1.5 -3.4
// Enter x2 and y2: 4 5
// The distance between the two points is 8.764131445842194
